# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Identifier-using-ML


This project is a deep learning–based system to identify diseases in tomato plant leaves 
using image classification. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on a 
labeled dataset of tomato leaf images to classify different diseases and healthy leaves.
The system also provides disease information and recommended actions through an interactive 
Streamlit dashboard.
